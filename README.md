# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### Description

To develop this project, a new React project was initialized and the Material-UI library was installed to leverage its components and styling. 
The main page component, Homepage, was created to serve as the application's entry point, utilizing Material-UI for layout and styling. 
Within the Homepage, a Sidebar component was developed that includes various options for opening different tabs, using Material-UI components to ensure a consistent and appealing design.
Next, a Candidate component was created to display a list of candidates. 
This component also includes filter options to allow users to filter the candidates based on selected criteria. 
Functionality was implemented within the Candidate component to dynamically filter the list of candidates as per the chosen filters, ensuring the displayed list updates accordingly. 
Throughout the development process, consistent styling and layout were maintained across the Homepage, Sidebar, and Candidate components using Material-UI to provide a cohesive userÂ experience.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
